Layout Architecture
Instead of a messy page with buttons everywhere, we use a Card-Based Grid System.

A. The Navigation (Tabs)
Don't use "folder style" tabs. Use a Segmented Control or a Sub-nav Underline.

Look: A simple horizontal list of text links. The active state has a thick, colored underline or a soft gray pill-shaped background.

Placement: Top of the page, below the "Earnings" header.

Screen-by-Screen Design Breakdown
Screen 1: Overview (/earnings/overview)
Goal: Instant clarity. "How much money do I have?"

The "Hero" Card:

Do: A clean white card. Top left: "Total Lifetime Earnings" (small, gray label). Below it: "$12,450.00" (Huge, bold, dark font).

Don't: Don't put a "wallet icon" next to the money. It looks cheap.

The Split: To the right of the total, split "Available" and "Pending" using a simple vertical divider.

Available: Black text.

Pending: Gray text (implies it's not real yet).

The Chart (Trend):

Style: A simple line chart or bar chart.

Anti-Cringe: Remove the grid lines. Remove the axis borders. Just show the curve. When the user hovers, show the tooltip.

Color: Use your primary accent color.

Screen 2: Breakdown (/earnings/breakdown)
Goal: Auditability.

The Data Table:

Structure: No vertical lines between columns. Only horizontal lines between rows.

Hierarchy:

Column 1 (Source): "Direct Referral" (Bold) + "Ref: John Doe" (Subtext in gray).

Column 2 (Date): "Oct 24, 2025".

Column 3 (Amount): Right-aligned. "+ $50.00".

Filters: Use a simple dropdown "pills" at the top right (e.g., [All Types v], [This Month v]).

Screen 3: Bonuses & Ranks (/earnings/bonuses, /earnings/ranking)
This is where it usually gets cringe (gold stars, trophies).

The "Rank" Visualization:

Avoid: 3D trophies, medals, or ribbons.

Do: A linear Progress Bar.

Visual: A thin gray track with a colored fill indicating progress to the next rank.

Labels: "Current: Silver" (Left) → "Next: Gold" (Right).

Stats: "80% Completed" displayed as simple text above the bar.

The Badges:

Use "Lozenges": Small, rounded rectangles with soft backgrounds.

Example: A "Qualified" badge should look like a tag on a shirt, not a sheriff's badge.

Style: Background #DCFCE7 (light green), Text #166534 (dark green), Font size 12px, Uppercase tracking.

Screen 4: CPV & Milestones (/earnings/cpv)
Goal: Tracking abstract points.

Metric Cards:

Display CPV (Cumulative Point Volume) exactly like a financial metric.

Label: "Total CPV Volume".

Value: "15,400 pts".

Milestone Timeline:

Use a vertical timeline list (like a shipment tracking UI).

Past (Achieved): Solid circle, black text.

Current (In Progress): Hollow circle with a pulsing border (subtle), bold text.

Future (Locked): Grayed out text, dotted line connecting them.

4. Component Specs (for your developers)
If you are handing this off, give them these specific rules to keep it tight:

Shadows: Use "diffused" shadows.

CSS: box-shadow: 0 1px 3px 0 rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1), 0 1px 2px -1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.1); (This is the standard Tailwind CSS shadow).

Borders:

Cards should have a 1px border of #E5E7EB (light gray) plus the shadow. This creates a "crisp" high-quality look.

Radius:

Keep it consistent. If you use 8px (0.5rem) for buttons, use 12px or 16px for cards. Do not mix pill-shapes with sharp corners.

Whitespace:

The Golden Rule of Professional UI: If it looks cluttered, add padding.

Inside a card, use at least 24px (1.5rem) of padding on all sides.
